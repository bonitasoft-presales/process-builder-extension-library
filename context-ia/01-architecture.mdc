# 01-architecture.mdc: Architectural Principles & Technology Stack

## 1. Technology Stack
* **Language:** Java 17+ (Mandatory)
* **Build Tool:** Maven (Defined in parent POM)
* **Core Framework:** Bonita Process Engine (Mandatory dependency management)

## 2. General Architecture
* **Separation of Concerns:** Code must be strictly divided into:
    1.  **REST API Extensions:** (Handling JSON mapping, authentication, DTOs).
    2.  **Service Layer:** (Business logic, transactions, BDM manipulation).
    3.  **Utility Layer:** (Stateless, isolated helper methods).
* **Dependency Rule:** Services MUST NOT directly call other Services outside of their immediate domain, favoring the use of **Bonita Commands** for cross-domain operations where transactions are involved.
* **API Consistency:** All external APIs (REST) must be consumed via dedicated, internal, immutable DTOs, never exposing Bonita's internal model classes directly.
