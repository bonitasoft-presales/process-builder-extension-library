# 00-overview.mdc: PROCESS-BUILDER-EXTERNAL-LIBRARY Project Context

## 1. Purpose: The Central Tooling Hub
The **PROCESS-BUILDER-EXTERNAL-LIBRARY** is the foundational artifact designed to **unify, standardize, and optimize** all Java-based extensions across the Bonita ecosystem (Process, UI, API). It serves as the single source of truth for critical data structures and utility logic.

### 1.1. Core Mandates: (Why this library exists)
1.  **Extreme Performance & Immutability:** Define core data contracts (DTOs/Records) to ensure strict immutability, thread-safety, and maximum efficiency. This is non-negotiable for achieving **near-zero GC overhead** and maintaining required performance benchmarks.
2.  **Code Standardization & Quality:** Enforce a single standard for API interaction, utility externalization, and domain logic consolidation, preventing code duplication across REST APIs, Connectors, Actor Filters, and Event Listeners.
3.  **Secure Bonita Integration:** Provide high-level, consistent patterns for accessing Bonita Engine APIs (e.g., `TenantAccessor`, Command API), abstracting low-level complexities while ensuring strict adherence to security best practices.

## 2. Development Context & Environment

| Area | Detail | Quality Standard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Technology Stack** | **Java 17+** (Mandatory for all new code) | Strict adherence to modern language features (Records, Sealed Types, etc.) for performance. |
| **Core Expertise** | Expert Java Development | Code must reflect best-in-class design patterns and clean code principles. |
| **DevOps** | **Docker, GitHub, and GitHub Actions** | All changes must integrate smoothly with the CI/CD pipeline. No build breaks allowed. |
| **Quality Gate** | **100% Test Coverage** (Mandatory for this project) | Must pass all static analysis checks (PMD, CheckStyle) as defined in the POM. |
