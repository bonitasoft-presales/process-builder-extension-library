/**
 * Provides non-instantiable utility classes containing application-wide static constants.
 * <p>
 * This package centralizes fixed values such as common strings (e.g., {@code "Test"}, 
 * {@code ""}), resource paths (e.g., {@code OPENAPI_RESOURCE_PATH}), and schema 
 * configurations (e.g., {@code SCHEMA_COMPONENTS_PREFIX}). Centralization ensures 
 * consistency and reduces the reliance on string literals throughout the application code.
 * </p>
