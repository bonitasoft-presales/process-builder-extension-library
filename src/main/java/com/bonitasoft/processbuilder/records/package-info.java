/**
 * Provides Record classes (available in Java 16 and later) which serve as 
 * containers for immutable and transparent data structures.
 * <p>
 * Records in this package are used to structure data read from or returned by 
 * business logic, such as process initiator information (e.g., {@link com.bonitasoft.processbuilder.records.ProcessInitiator}), 
 * simplifying data handling and eliminating the boilerplate code for constructors, 
 * {@code equals()}, {@code hashCode()}, and {@code toString()} methods.
